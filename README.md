# Predicting Passenger Survival in Titanic Shipwreck using Machine Learning (Classification Problem)
This is a classification project I've done while learning Machine Learning. It is the introduction project in kaggle website which is about predicting the survibility of the passengers given the features provided in the titanic dataset

Tools and Libraries used:
* EDA and Visualization:
  - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* Machine Learning Models from sci-kit learn:
  - LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
